# My implementation of Wave Function Collapse Algorithm

## Library used :-
* p5.js

*In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function—initially in a superposition of several eigenstates—reduces to a single eigenstate due to interaction with the external world. This interaction is called an observation, and is the essence of a measurement in quantum mechanics, which connects the wave function with classical observables such as position and momentum. Collapse is one of the two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is the continuous evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation.Collapse is a black box for a thermodynamically irreversible interaction with a classical environment.*

### Further improvements
[] - Make it applicable for asymetric tiles and multiple socket types ex: ('AAA','ABB').
[] - Introduce backtracking
